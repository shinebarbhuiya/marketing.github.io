I will not pass on your details to any third party and do not         send out marketing e-mails to customers unless they have registered to         receive such material, purchased from me, or downloaded one of my free or         paid products.<br />

            I will not use your personal information for any other reason other than         to contact you. We do not sell, give away or rent your email address to         any third party. If in the future I did for any reason wish to rent, sell         or use your email address for any other purpose we will ask you for your         permission first.<br />
  <br />
